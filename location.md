## Address

The meeting takes place in the Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Technologies (FAMNIT).  The FAMNIT building is at the address Glagoljaška 8, and is in the old town center of Koper.

<ul>

 <li>Lectures and events will be held in the lecture room VP2, located on the first floor.</li>

 <li>Coffee breaks will be held in the Avla hall, located on the ground floor</li>

 <li>Breakout rooms will be MP5 and MP6 on Monday/Thursday; MP2 and MP4 on Tuesday/Wednesday/Friday.<br/>  All are located on the second floor.</li>
 
</ul>

Rooms are equipped both with whiteboards, and also with a projector / computer / hdmi connection.  Note that in VP2, the projector screen covers part (indeed, much) of the whiteboard when it is down.  

## Eating
The town center of Koper has many lunch / dinner options, as well as bakeries and grocery stores.

We have written a small [restaurant guide](https://osebje.famnit.upr.si/~russ.woodroofe/restaurants/).

# Getting there
Koper has several nearby airports.  Trieste (TRS) is the closest; Ljubljana (LJU) is nearly as close and sometimes better connected.  Venice Marco Polo (VCE) is a major international airport, and is only about 2 hours away by shuttle.  Other airports that may be worth looking at include Pula (PUY, regional airport), Venice Treviso (TSF, regional airport), Zagreb (ZAG, international airport).  All of these airports have service from the [GoOpti shuttle service ](https://www.goopti.com/en/); it is a good idea to book a GoOpti shuttle at least two weeks ahead.

There are a few Flixbuses that go directly to Koper.  By train, you are probably best off to travel to Trieste or Ljubljana, and take a bus from there.  Busses are usually quicker and more frequent than trains inside of Slovenia.

More advice on getting to Koper can be found on the webpage for the [12th PhD Summer School in Discrete Mathematics](https://conferences.famnit.upr.si/event/33/page/290-getting-to-koper), to be held shortly after GAP Days.
