## Preparations before GAP Days

In preparation for these GAP Days please get your resources up to date.
Please note that this list will be updated on the go, as we find more things that need to be prepared.

- make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com) (they are free)
- make sure you can log in to [HackMD.io](https://hackmd.io), e.g. via your GitHub account
- get/check access to the [gap-system slack](https://gap-system.org/slack), in which there is a dedicated GAP Days channel.

- You should have a recent version of GAP installed (ideally 4.14.x or a development version built from the master branch)
