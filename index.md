## GAP Days in general

[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) is a system for computational discrete algebra.
GAP Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to discuss, influence, and
contribute to the future development of GAP. To streamline each meeting, the
organisers usually suggest a few main topics to work on during the week.

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in GAP
itself, and its packages, via short talks.  However, the focus of the meetings
is on development, with talks playing only a minor role.  As enough GAP experts
will be around for advice and technical support, the meetings offer particularly
good opportunities for people to work on their own packages. At the end of the
week, we would be happy to hear about any progress you made.

Please visit [gapdays.de](https://www.gapdays.de) for a list of all GAP Days.

<!--
The focus of these GAP Days will be on the GAP Package distribution
and its infrastructure.
Please visit the [topics page]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics) for details.

The GAP Days Summer 2025 will be the first edition in Koper, Slovenia!

<!--
Since this is the first edition on Belgian soil, the organizers would like 
to include a number of minicourses on a diverse range of mathematical topics, 
including topics from group theory, algebra and discrete mathematics. A minicourse
will consist of three hours of lectures and three hours of guided exercises (in GAP, obviously). 
We will organize parallel sessions for developers. As such, 
master and PhD students in mathematics interested to use GAP to support their mathematical
work, will be able to learn GAP and also meet developers. 

The minicourse will be given by researchers who are also enthusiastic GAP users and/or GAP developers. 
We have confirmed minicourses by [Ilaria Colazzo](https://www.ilariacolazzo.info/new/), [Bettina Eick](http://www.iaa.tu-bs.de/beick/)
and [Michel Lavrauw](https://osebje.famnit.upr.si/~michel.lavrauw/). The preliminarie contents of the minicourses can 
be found at the [the program page]({{ site.baseurl }}/program).

We warmly invite all people interested with
little knowledge of the insides of GAP to join in as well: this includes undergraduate
students, PhD students, post-docs, and more experienced mathematicians. You will
be able to meet us and each other, and learn about GAP development and
algorithmic group theory in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
